 Open Wounds lyrics

In the dark with the music on 
Wishing I was somewhere else 
Taking all your anger out on me, somebody help 
I would rather rot alone 
Than spend a minute with you 
I'm gone, I'm gone 

And you can't stop me from falling apart 
'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault 

[Chorus]
How could you, how could you, how could you hate me? 
When all I ever wanted to be was you? 
How could you, how could you, how could you love me? 
When all you ever gave me were open wounds? 

Downstairs the enemy sleeps 
Leaving the TV on 
Watching all the dreams we had turn into static 
Doesn't matter what I do 
Nothing's gonna change 
I'm never good enough 

And you can't stop me from falling apart 
'Cause my self-destruction is all your fault 

[Chorus]
