 You're In My Brain lyrics

It's so urgent; it's so desperate 
I can feel it in my bones (yeah) 
To find a shovel and start digging 
Under the water, bury myself 

[Chorus:]
You're in my brain 
In my brain 
The life inside is breaking out 
You're in my brain 
In my brain 
The life inside is breaking out 

It's getting stronger; I can't contain it 
It's like a fire in my bones (yeah) 
It's taking over, recreating 
Transforming my mind (yeah) 

[CHORUS]

You're in my mind, in my mind 
Breaking out [repeat]

[CHORUS (repeat)]
