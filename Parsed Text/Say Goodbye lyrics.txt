 Say Goodbye lyrics

Things are changing 
It seems strange and 
I need to figure this out 
You've got your life 
I got mine 
But you're all I cared about 
Yesterday we were laughing 
Today I'm left here asking 
Where has all the time gone now 
I'm left alone somehow 
Growing up and getting older 
I don't want to believe it's over 

[Chorus:]
Don't say goodbye 
Cause I don't wanna hear those words tonight 
Cause maybe it's not the end for you and I 
And although we knew 
This time would come for me and you 
Don't say anything tonight 
If you're gonna say goodbye 

Do you remember 
In December 
How we swore we'd never change 
Even though you're leaving 
That our feelings 
Would always stay the same 
I wish we could be laughing 
Instead I'm standing here asking 
Do we have to end this now 
Can we make it last somehow 
We both know what we've gotta say, not today 
Cause I don't wanna leave this way 

[Bridge:]
And if it's over 
It hurts but I'm giving you my word 
I hope that you're always 
Happy like we were 
Happy like we were 

[Altro:]
Yesterday we were laughing (if you're gonna say goodbye) 
Today I'm left here asking (if you're gonna say goodbye) 
And although we knew this time would come for me and you 
Don't say anything tonight 
If you're gonna say goodbye
